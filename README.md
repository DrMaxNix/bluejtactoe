BlueJ-Tac-Toe is a java implementation of Tic-tac-toe with BlueJ. This was a school project where we had to program a game of our choice in one week using BlueJ, so it's not the best piece of code but maybe it can help you out.. :)

## Installation Instructions
- [Install BlueJ](https://bluej.org/)
- Download the files
- Unpack them (don't forget this step, otherwise BlueJ won't be able to open the rest of the files!)
- Open package.bluej with BlueJ
